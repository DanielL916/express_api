## Steps to take before running the example:

1. [Getting Started The Easy Way with Beame.io SDK](https://github.com/beameio/beame-sdk#getting-started-the-easy-way)
2. `git clone https://github.com/beameio/beame-sdk.git`
3. `cd example`
4. `npm install`
5. In `index.js` change `var devHostname` with Hostname you got by email when creating a developer
6. Run it with `node index.js`.
7. In console output you will see something like:  
`Server started on: https://h3a6ipg1jz95x35n.v1.r.p.edge.eu-central-1b-1.v1.p.beameio.net`
`{ Hostname: 'h3a6ipg1jz95x35n.v1.r.p.edge.eu-central-1b-1.v1.p.beameio.net' }`  

8. Go to web brower and direct it to your new secure web server by copying https://*hostname* from console output  
That's that. You have your own https server running on your local machine, available from allover the world :)
